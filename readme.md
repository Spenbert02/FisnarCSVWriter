# README
FisnarCSVWriter is a plugin for Utlimaker's [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) slicer software that adds functionality for printing
CAD files with Fisnar dispensing robots. It is still in development and this
page will be updated regularly.

## Fisnar Robots
Fisnar dispensing robots are used extensively in industry to automate fluid
dispensing processes. These robots also function well as direct-ink-writing
3D printers for additive manufacturing at the micro to meso-scale. Fisnar dispensing robots
do not come with support for printing CAD files, however. Their command language
is unique and is not supported by any reliable slicer software. This plugin
solves this issue.

## Downloading
The easiest way to download the plugin will be to download it from Ultimaker's
(plugin marketplace)[https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins]. This
plugin isn't published there yet, but once it is it can be found by searching
'FisnarCSVWriter' on the plugin marketplace page.

## Fisnar Commands Used
'Z Clearance', 'Dummy Point', 'Output', 'Line Speed', 'End Program'.
